📋 DevOps Journey – Day 1 Notes (Ubuntu Setup on Windows)
🖥 Step 1: Check Your Operating System
You are using Windows.

Install Ubuntu inside Windows using WSL2.

🛠 Step 2: Install and Set Up Ubuntu (WSL2)
If WSL and Ubuntu are not installed yet:

Open Command Prompt (cmd) as Administrator.

Run:

bash
Copy code
wsl --install
Install Ubuntu (if not already).

Set your Ubuntu username and password (one-time setup).

⚡ Step 3: Update and Upgrade Ubuntu Packages
After opening Ubuntu terminal, run:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
(Updates software packages and security patches.)

🛠 Step 4: Install Essential Tools for DevOps
Run this single command:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install -y curl wget git vim net-tools
✅ This installs:

curl → For downloading files

wget → Another downloader

git → Version control

vim → Text editor

net-tools → Network utilities

✅ Step 5: Verify Installation
Check if Git is working:

bash
Copy code
git --version
Check network tool:

bash
Copy code
ifconfig
(If ifconfig command works, net-tools installed correctly.)

🎉 Step 6: Celebrate!
(Optional fun after installation):

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install cowsay
cowsay "Day 1 Completed! 🎉"
