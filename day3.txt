📅 Day 3: Linux File Permissions
✅ Topics Covered:
Types of File Permissions:

r – Read: View file contents or list directory.

w – Write: Modify file or directory contents.

x – Execute: Run file (if script or binary) or access directory.

Permission Categories:

User (u) – Owner of the file.

Group (g) – Users in the same group as the owner.

Others (o) – Everyone else.

Checking Permissions:

Command: ls -l

Shows file type, permissions, owner, group, size, etc.

Changing Permissions – chmod:

Symbolic Mode:

Example: chmod u+x file.sh (adds execute to user)

Numeric Mode:

Example: chmod 755 file.sh

Breakdown:

7 = read + write + execute

5 = read + execute

Changing Ownership – chown:

Syntax: sudo chown user:group file.sh

Handling Protected Files:

Use sudo for actions needing elevated permissions.

Example: sudo rm -r protected_directory

🛠️ Practice Tasks Completed:
Created and navigated directories using mkdir and cd.

Created files and added content using echo and redirection.

Changed permissions and ownership of files and directories.

Handled deletion of write-protected directories using sudo.

Explored permission errors and resolved using correct commands.
